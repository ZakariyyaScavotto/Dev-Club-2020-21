    <h1>About CSS</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, also known as CSS, is used to make your webpage look pretty.</p>
    <p>You can have as many stylesheets as you need for an HTML file.</p>
    <p>CSS can be used to define both the style <b>and</b> the layout of your webpage.</p>
    <h2>How do I use CSS?</h2>
    <p>To use CSS, you select an element, then you choose its property, and then you apply a value, as shown:</p>
      <p>selector {
        <br>property: value;
      <br>}</p>
    <p>An example:</p>
      <p>p {
        <br>color: red;
      <br>}</p>
      <br>
    <p>This would change the color of the text in your paragraphs from black to red.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Each selector can have as many properties as you want, as shown:</p>
    <p>body {
<br>background: #FFFFFF;
<br>Font-family: “Courier New”, Verdana, sans-serif;
<br>}
</p>
  </body>
</html>
