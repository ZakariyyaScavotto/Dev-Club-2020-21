    <h1>About HTML</h1>

    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a language that is used to display documents in a web browser.
      <br>
      <br>HTML is made up of several main components, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tags, and Their Attributes</li>
      <li>Data Types</li>
      <li>Character References</li>
      <li>Entity References</li>
      <li>Elements</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Tags and Their Attributes</h2>
    <p>Tags are what you write your HTML inside of. They consist of an opening tag and a closing tag.
      <br>
      <br>An opening tag is shown by &lt;and &gt;, while a closing tag is shown by &lt; and /&gt;
      <br>
      <br>A common tag that you will see is the paragraph tag, which lets you write text. It is represented by &lt;p&gt;Your text here&lt;/p&gt;
      <br>
      <br>Some other common tags you will see include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, which are used to writing headings.</li>
      <li>&lt;br&gt;, which is used to add a line break. Fun fact: It is one of few HTML tags that don't need to be closed!</li>
      <li>Text modifying tags, such as &lt;b&gt; to <b>bold text</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are many more tags out there, here is a helpful list of HTML tags:</p>
