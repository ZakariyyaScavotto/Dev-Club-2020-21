Structured Query Language (SQL)
Focused on operations vs. program features(loops)
CREATE: create different tables in database (like creating new sheet in spreadsheet)
INSERT: insert new row(s) into table
SELECT: select given rows, provide certain condition
UPDATE: select row and change values
DELETE: delete rows

CREATE TABLE 'students'
	('id' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 'name' TEXT, 'county' TEXT) #Adds categories into table with name and the data type
	
INSERT INTO "students" ("id", "name", "county") #Add into table specifying the order of values
#Convention: single quotes for creating/inputing
	VALUES(1, 'Alex', 'FCPS')
	
SELECT * FROM "students" #* = wildcard, selects all from students

UPDATE "students" set "name" = 'Alex Suh' WHERE id=1 #updates row, setting name of row to Alex Suh based on id

DELETE FROM "students" WHERE id = 1
